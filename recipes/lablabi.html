        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Lablabi, also known as Tunisian Chickpea Soup or Stew, is a hearty North African meal featuring chickpeas, rustic bread, warm spices, and more. Served with a variety of garnishes, it’s the perfect vegetarian comfort food!         </p>
        <h2><strong>Ingrediants</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>chickpeas:</strong>To cut down on prep work, I used two 15-ounce cans, but if you’ve got the time, you could also cook them yourself. I’ll teach you how here! </li>
            <li><strong>rustic bread:</strong>Toast bread to golden perfection and add to the bottom of your bowl to soak up the liquid from the chickpea stew and add an irresistible crunchy, chewy texture. </li>
            <li><strong><em>extra</em> virgin olive oil:</strong>You know how much I love olive oil, and this Tunisian chickpea stew has an abundance! I used our Private Reserve olive oil throughout the entire recipe to help toast the bread, sauté the veggies, and add extra flavor to the finished soup! </li>
            <li><strong>aromatic:</strong>Yellow onion and garlic are sautéed until they’re golden and fragrant to add extra savory goodness and a bit of kick to this recipe. </li>
            <li><strong>spices:</strong>Salt, cumin, coriander, and paprika creates the warm, complex flavor for which lablabi is known. </li>
            <li><strong>harrisa paste:</strong> This North African chili paste is made with red chilies, garlic, olive oil, citrus, and warm spices. We have a recipe on the site for homemade harissa or you can pick up some jarred harissa from the shop so it's ready when you are. We’ll start with just 1 tablespoon and add more to individual servings.</li>
            <li><strong>lemons:</strong>We’ll need two for this lablabi recipe. One will be juiced, and the other will be sliced for serving. The bright notes of this citrus fruit lightens the dish, creating a delicious well-rounded flavor.  </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong><li>Prepare the chickpeas</strong></li></h3><br>
        <img src="../images/brokenbread.jpg" height="300" width="500">
        <p>Add your canned chickpeas with their liquids to a saucepan. Cover them with water, making sure they’re submerged by roughly an inch. Bring the liquid to a boil. Then, lower the heat to medium-low. Cover the pot partially with the lid and let the beans simmer until they’re super tender. This should take about 30 minutes. </p><br>

        <h3><strong><li>Sauté the aromatics</li></strong></h3><br>
        <p>Add more olive oil to a medium-sized non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer but isn’t so hot it’s sizzling, and add your onions, garlic, and spices. Cook the ingredients, stirring frequently until the onions are translucent and the mixture is fragrant.  </p>

        <h3><strong><li>Season the chickpea stew</li></strong></h3><br>
            <p>Transfer the onion mixture to the pot of chickpeas, and add the remaining ingredients. Give them all a good stir, and adjust the seasonings to suit your preferences. </p>

        <h3><strong><li>Portion, garnish, and serve</li></strong></h3><br>
        <p>Now comes the fun part! Grab your serving bowls, and add some of the toasted bread to the bottom of each. Ladle the chickpea stew on top followed by extra flavor enhancers like more harissa, green onions or a poached egg. Sprinkle your favorite garnishes on top, and dig in while it’s warm! </p>
