        <h2><strong>Ingrediants</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>chickpeas:</strong>To cut down on prep work, I used two 15-ounce cans, but if you’ve got the time, you could also cook them yourself. I’ll teach you how here! </li>
            <li><strong>rustic bread:</strong>Toast bread to golden perfection and add to the bottom of your bowl to soak up the liquid from the chickpea stew and add an irresistible crunchy, chewy texture. </li>
            <li><strong><em>extra</em> virgin olive oil:</strong>You know how much I love olive oil, and this Tunisian chickpea stew has an abundance! I used our Private Reserve olive oil throughout the entire recipe to help toast the bread, sauté the veggies, and add extra flavor to the finished soup! </li>
            <li><strong>aromatic:</strong>Yellow onion and garlic are sautéed until they’re golden and fragrant to add extra savory goodness and a bit of kick to this recipe. </li>
            <li><strong>spices:</strong>Salt, cumin, coriander, and paprika creates the warm, complex flavor for which lablabi is known. </li>
            <li><strong>harrisa paste:</strong> This North African chili paste is made with red chilies, garlic, olive oil, citrus, and warm spices. We have a recipe on the site for homemade harissa or you can pick up some jarred harissa from the shop so it's ready when you are. We’ll start with just 1 tablespoon and add more to individual servings.</li>
            <li><strong>lemons:</strong>We’ll need two for this lablabi recipe. One will be juiced, and the other will be sliced for serving. The bright notes of this citrus fruit lightens the dish, creating a delicious well-rounded flavor.  </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong><li>Prepare the chickpeas</strong></li></h3><br>
        <p>Add your canned chickpeas with their liquids to a saucepan. Cover them with water, making sure they’re submerged by roughly an inch. Bring the liquid to a boil. Then, lower the heat to medium-low. Cover the pot partially with the lid and let the beans simmer until they’re super tender. This should take about 30 minutes. </p><br>
