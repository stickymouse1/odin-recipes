        <li><h4>Prepare the Green Harissa:        </h4></li>
        <p>Toast cumin and coriander seeds in a small skillet over medium, stirring often, until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a food processor. Add parsley, cilantro, jalapeños, scallions, garlic, lemon zest and juice, and salt to food processor. Pulse until mixture is finely chopped, about 8 pulses, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed. With food processor running, gradually drizzle in oil.</p>

        <img src="../images/brikimgs/prepareharissa3.webp" height="300" width="300" alt="preparing harissa 3rd img">
        <p>Process until mixture is well combined and mostly smooth, about 15 seconds. Season to taste with additional salt. Cover and store in refrigerator until ready to use or up to 1 day.        </p>
        <li><h4>Prepare the Filling:        </h4></li>
        <img src="../images/brikimgs/toastpotato.webp" width="300" height="300" alt="toast potatoes">
        <p>Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss together potatoes, fennel, oil, salt, and pepper on a baking sheet. Spread in an even layer. Bake in preheated oven until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl; let cool 10 minutes. Stir in feta, parsley, and fennel fronds. Set aside.        </p>
        <li><h4>Prepare the Brik:        </h4></li>
        <ol>
        <img src="../images/brikimgs/blenderimage.webp" width="300" height="300" alt="blender image so cool">
        <li><p>While Filling bakes, place flour, semolina, 1 cup water, oil, and salt in a blender. Process until smooth, about 15 seconds. Set aside.        </p></li>
        <img src="../images/brikimgs/fryingblender.webp" width="300" height="300" alt="now a frying pan on a blender">
        <li><p>Fill a large pot with water to a depth of 2 inches; bring to a boil over medium-high. Reduce heat to medium-low to maintain a simmer; place a 12-inch nonstick skillet on top of the pot of water. Very lightly grease skillet with oil, and rub with a paper towel to distribute. Using a pastry brush with natural bristles, quickly brush about 2 tablespoons of the flour mixture in a thin layer over bottom of skillet. Cook until pastry is matte all over and edges release from skillet, 1 minute, 30 seconds to 2 minutes.        </p></li>
        <img src="../images/brikimgs/brikfry.webp" width="300" height="300" alt="brik joined the frier">
        <li><p>Carefully peel up pastry using the lifted edge, and place on a clean dish towel. Using a second pastry brush, lightly coat top of cooked pastry with oil; cover with a clean dish towel. Repeat process (no need to grease skillet again) with 2 tablespoons batter at a time to form 12 pastry sheets total, brushing each sheet with oil before stacking between towels to prevent from sticking and drying out. Discard any remaining batter.        </p></li>
        <img src="../images/brikimgs/bunchofbriks.webp" width="300" height="300" alt="bunch of briks just chilling">
        <li><p>Transfer 2 pastry sheets to a clean work surface, and stack on top of each other. Keep remaining sheets covered. Fold pastry sides in to form a 6-inch square. Place about 1/4 cup Filling on 1 diagonal half of the pastry, leaving a 3/4-inch border around the edge. Form a 1 1/2-inch well in the center, and crack 1 egg into the well. It's OK if some of the egg white spills out; just wipe away with a paper towel. Sprinkle egg lightly with salt and pepper to taste.        </p></li>

        <img src="../images/brikimgs/foldedbrik.webp" height="300" width="300" alt="brik folded">
        <li><p>Fold empty pastry half over the egg, being careful not to break the yolk. Firmly press pastry edges together to seal and form a triangle. Repeat process with 2 pastry sheets, 1/4 cup Filling, and 1 egg to form a second triangle.        </p></li>
        <li><p>Pour oil into a large cast-iron skillet to a depth of 1/2 inch; heat over medium-high to 375°F. Fry pastries, 2 at a time, until golden and crisp, 1 minute, 30 seconds to 2 minutes per side. Using a fish spatula, transfer pastries to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain.        </p></li>
        <img src="../images/brikimgs/finsihedbrik.webp" width="300" height="300" alt="cooked brik img">
        <li><p>Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with remaining 8 pastry sheets, Filling, and 4 eggs, adjusting temperature under skillet as needed to maintain oil temperature of 375°F. Serve hot alongside Green Harissa.        </p></li>
